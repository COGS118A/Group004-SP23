    "Airbnb is a well known internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. Hosts often face difficulty in determining an optimal price for their listings. Both overpricing and underpricing can lead to revenue loss. To solve this problem, we use previews listed Airbnb in San Diego including their price and descriptions to encode those into machine learning models. \n",
    " We aim to develop a model that can successfully predict Airbnb prices in San Diego based on relevant property features. We measure the model’s accuracy using R^2 and calculate the loss using RMSE. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "On May 5, 2023, the CDC announced the End of the Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) Declaration, signaling an official end to this unprecedented pandemic. What's to come is the recovery of the global travel market. Across the entire world, there are currently over 4 million+ Airbnb hosts worldwide and 6 million+ active listings on the platform. In addition to the staggering number of hosts, there are more than 150 million users, and the overall number of bookings through Airbnb has surpassed 100 million.<a name=\"airbnbstats\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#airbnbstats) In the area of San Diego alone, there are a total of 12,871 listings, with 87.1% of them being short-term rentals. Additionally, 66.3% of hosts have multiple listings, indicating that most hosts have more than one property on the market.<a name=\"airbnbsd\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#airbnbsd) For those with a large number of listing properties, it becomes challenging to thoroughly investigate and change prices daily. Therefore, having a comparable prediction as a reference for their decision would be beneficial. The potential of the short-term rental market is enormous and growing exponentially. However, it's not just people with multiple listings who struggle with setting a fair price; new hosts also typically face difficulties when initially deciding on the price for their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to list your home on airbnb, you’ll need to do market research on the similar homes near you, finding out the average price of the market, and then determine the price that you would like to set for your home. The problem is that you can’t list a price and never change it forever. You need to change the price frequently based on market price, which means each time you want to change the price you need to do the market research again, which is a lot of work. In this case, if you have a program that can predict the price base on the model that has previously been trained on similar data from already existing listings would be pretty helpful. \n"

We aim to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze past data and train a predictive model that can most accurately predict the most profitable airbnb price based on the property’s features and location. \n"

    "\n",
    "We plan to build at least two models using Sklearn modules to compare their results for predicting airbnb prices in San Diego. Our thought is to use RandomForestRegressor model and polynomial regression model. Since our data consist of a decent amount of categorical variables as well as numerical variables, we will use one-hot encoding before putting all those data into two models. In order to test our model and to see how our models can generalize on unseen data, we will split our data into testing and training. For the training data, we will then use k-fold validation and GridSearchCV to make sure our data is not overfitting and tune our hyperparameter accordingly. \n",

If an individual whose data is included in our project requests for their data to be erased, we are obligated to do so, provided there are no legal grounds for retaining it. This helps to ensure that individuals maintain control over their personal data.\n",
    "    - Data retention plan:\n",

    "Our datasets record the fundamental features of listings in San Diego are. The data it contained does not contain any information that can be related to stereotype perpetuation or imbalance classes. One variable that might be confounding in our dataset is “license”. According to our research, Airbnb's official forum provides information regarding this feature. Excerpting from Airbnb’s official response: “Some cities require Hosts to obtain a license or registration number to list their places on Airbnb. The corresponding field on their listing allows them to show that number for compliance.” This provides us an understanding of what a license is and how it applies to the property listing. Additionally, Airbnb also suggests that “license” might not be necessary for some cities, depending on the policies. For those properties that have status ‘city registration pending’ or ‘exempt’, Airbnb claims that it will not affect the veracity and safety of the listings.\n",

    "We will prioritize fairness across all groups to ensure that no one group will receive favor based on any characteristics. We will utilize techniques to check if our model is biased, and if it is, we will mitigate it and re-evaluate our model.\n",

    "    - Explainability:\n",

    "- Deployment\n",

    "Redress\n",
    "    - Roll back:\n",
    "A roll-back plan will be in place to revert to a previous version of the model or even to stop using the model altogether if serious issues arise. This could be necessary if the model starts performing poorly or if significant bias is discovered that can't be quickly mitigated. \n",
