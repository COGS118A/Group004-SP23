    "\n",
    "Airbnb is a well known internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. Hosts often face difficulty in determining an optimal price for their listings. Both overpricing and underpricing can lead to revenue loss. To solve this problem, we use previews listed Airbnb in San Diego including their price and descriptions to encode those into machine learning models. \n",
    " We aim to develop a model that can successfully predict Airbnb prices in San Diego based on relevant property features. We measure the model’s accuracy using R^2 and calculate the loss using RMSE. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "On May 5, 2023, the CDC announced the End of the Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) Declaration, signaling an official end to this unprecedented pandemic. What's to come is the recovery of the global travel market. Across the entire world, there are currently over 4 million+ Airbnb hosts worldwide and 6 million+ active listings on the platform. In addition to the staggering number of hosts, there are more than 150 million users, and the overall number of bookings through Airbnb has surpassed 100 million.<a name=\"airbnbstats\"></a>[<sup>[1]</sup>](#airbnbstats) In the area of San Diego alone, there are a total of 12,871 listings, with 87.1% of them being short-term rentals. Additionally, 66.3% of hosts have multiple listings, indicating that most hosts have more than one property on the market.<a name=\"airbnbsd\"></a>[<sup>[2]</sup>](#airbnbsd) For those with a large number of listing properties, it becomes challenging to thoroughly investigate and change prices daily. Therefore, having a comparable prediction as a reference for their decision would be beneficial. The potential of the short-term rental market is enormous and growing exponentially. However, it's not just people with multiple listings who struggle with setting a fair price; new hosts also typically face difficulties when initially deciding on the price for their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to list your home on airbnb, you’ll need to do market research on the similar homes near you, finding out the average price of the market, and then determine the price that you would like to set for your home. The problem is that you can’t list a price and never change it forever. You need to change the price frequently based on market price, which means each time you want to change the price you need to do the market research again, which is a lot of work. In this case, if you have a program that can predict the price base on the model that has previously been trained on similar data from already existing listings would be pretty helpful. \n"

    "# Proposed Solution\n",
    "\n",
    "We plan to build at least two models using Sklearn modules to compare their results for predicting airbnb prices in San Diego. Our thought is to use RandomForestRegressor model and polynomial regression model. Since our data consist of a decent amount of categorical variables as well as numerical variables, we will use one-hot encoding before putting all those data into two models. In order to test our model and to see how our models can generalize on unseen data, we will split our data into testing and training. For the training data, we will then use k-fold validation and GridSearchCV to make sure our data is not overfitting and tune our hyperparameter accordingly. \n",
    "Our General Plan as for now consist of those following step:\n",
    "1. Data cleaning and using python and pandas\n",
    "    - Drop out irrelevant features and data\n",
    "    - Univariate Analysis\n",

    "    - One-hot encoding for categorical features \n",
    "    - Assess numerical features and standardize relevant features \n",
    "3. Split the dataset into testing and training \n",
    "4. Build a baseline model \n",
    "5. Implement two models, use k-fold cross validation and GridSearchCV\n",
    "6. After achieving good prediction use the best performed model on testing dataset"

    "    - Informed consent:\n",
    "Our dataset is extracted from official documentation published by Airbnb. The information can be searched online and hosts sign a form of consent when the properties are listed on the market, so there should not be any legal issues.\n",
    "    - Collection bias:\n",
    "The dataset is comprehensively collected from every single listing in the area of San Diego. So, there is no foreseeable bias in the process of data collection.\n",

If an individual whose data is included in our project requests for their data to be erased, we are obligated to do so, provided there are no legal grounds for retaining it. This helps to ensure that individuals maintain control over their personal data.\n",
    "    - Data retention plan:\n",

    "Our datasets record the fundamental features of listings in San Diego are. The data it contained does not contain any information that can be related to stereotype perpetuation or imbalance classes. One variable that might be confounding in our dataset is “license”. According to our research, Airbnb's official forum provides information regarding this feature. Excerpting from Airbnb’s official response: “Some cities require Hosts to obtain a license or registration number to list their places on Airbnb. The corresponding field on their listing allows them to show that number for compliance.” This provides us an understanding of what a license is and how it applies to the property listing. Additionally, Airbnb also suggests that “license” might not be necessary for some cities, depending on the policies. For those properties that have status ‘city registration pending’ or ‘exempt’, Airbnb claims that it will not affect the veracity and safety of the listings.\n",

    "    - Fairness across groups:\n",
    "We will prioritize fairness across all groups to ensure that no one group will receive favor based on any characteristics. We will utilize techniques to check if our model is biased, and if it is, we will mitigate it and re-evaluate our model.\n",
    "    - Metric selection:\n",
    "RMSE\n",
    "    - Explainability:\n",
    "We aim to choose a model that achieves a balance between explainability and accuracy. While more complex models offer better accuracy and predictiveness, it will more often be harder to explain. It is important for us to understand how a model is making its decisions.\n",

    "- Deployment\n",
    "    - Monitoring and evaluation:\n",
    "Once the model is deployed, there is a need to monitor the performance and fairness continuously. We will track metrics like the model’s accuracy and potential bias over time and across different groups.\n",
    "Redress\n",
    "    - Roll back:\n",
    "A roll-back plan will be in place to revert to a previous version of the model or even to stop using the model altogether if serious issues arise. This could be necessary if the model starts performing poorly or if significant bias is discovered that can't be quickly mitigated. \n",
    "    - Redress:\n",
    "We will officially apologize to those who are harmed by our project and provide contact information for them to reach out for a solution\n",
    "    - Unintended use:\n",
    "Some unintended use for our project can be customers/guests using our results to argue with the host for lower prices, which might have negative effects on the revenue of listing properties.\n"
