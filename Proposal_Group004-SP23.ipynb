    "# Project Description\n",
    "\n",
    "You will design and execute a machine learning project. There are a few constraints on the nature of the allowed project. \n",
    "- The problem addressed will not be a \"toy problem\" or \"common training students problem\" like mtcars, iris, palmer penguins etc.\n",
    "- The dataset will have >1k observations and >5 variables. I'd prefer more like >10k observations and >10 variables. A general rule is that if you have >100x more observations than variables, your solution will likely generalize a lot better. The goal of training a supervised machine learning model is to learn the underlying pattern in a dataset in order to generalize well to unseen data, so choosing a large dataset is very important.\n",
    "\n",
    "- The project will include a model selection and/or feature selection component where you will be looking for the best setup to maximize the performance of your ML system.\n",
    "- You will evaluate the performance of your ML system using more than one appropriate metric\n",
    "- You will be writing a report describing and discussing these accomplishments\n",

    "# Abstract \n",
    "\n",
    "Airbnb is a well known internet marketplace for short-term home and apartment rentals. Hosts often face difficulty in determining an optimal price for their listings. Both overpricing and underpricing can lead to revenue loss. To solve this problem, we use previews listed Airbnb in San Diego including their price and descriptions to encode those into machine learning models. \n",
    " We aim to develop a model that can successfully predict Airbnb prices in San Diego based on relevant property features. We measure the model’s accuracy using R^2 and calculate the loss using RMSE. "

    "# Background\n",
    "\n",
    "On May 5, 2023, the CDC announced the End of the Federal COVID-19 Public Health Emergency (PHE) Declaration, signaling an official end to this unprecedented pandemic. What's to come is the recovery of the global travel market. Across the entire world, there are currently over 4 million+ Airbnb hosts worldwide and 6 million+ active listings on the platform. In addition to the staggering number of hosts, there are more than 150 million users, and the overall number of bookings through Airbnb has surpassed 100 million.【1】In the area of San Diego alone, there are a total of 12,871 listings, with 87.1% of them being short-term rentals. Additionally, 66.3% of hosts have multiple listings, indicating that most hosts have more than one property on the market.【2】For those with a large number of listing properties, it becomes challenging to thoroughly investigate and change prices daily. Therefore, having a comparable prediction as a reference for their decision would be beneficial. The potential of the short-term rental market is enormous and growing exponentially. However, it's not just people with multiple listings who struggle with setting a fair price; new hosts also typically face difficulties when initially deciding on the price for their listings.\n",
    "\n",
    "When you try to list your home on airbnb, you’ll need to do market research on the similar homes near you, finding out the average price of the market, and then determine the price that you would like to set for your home. The problem is that you can’t list a price and never change it forever. You need to change the price frequently based on market price, which means each time you want to change the price you need to do the market research again, which is a lot of work. In this case, if you have a program that can predict the price base on the model that has previously been trained on similar data from already existing listings would be pretty helpful. \n"

    "\n",
    "Setting a reasonable price for an airbnb host is hard to achieve. They need to predict other similar listings’ prices in order to maximize the profit. We aim to utilize machine learning algorithms to analyze past data and train a predictive model that can most accurately predict the most profitable airbnb price based on the property’s features and location. \n"

    "- Data Collection:\n",
    "    - Informed consent:\n",
    "Our dataset is extracted from official documentation published by Airbnb. The information can be searched online and hosts sign a form of consent when the properties are listed on the market, so there should not be any legal issues.\n",
    "    - Collection bias:\n",
    "The dataset is comprehensively collected from every single listing in the area of San Diego. So, there is no foreseeable bias in the process of data collection.\n",
    "    - Limit PII exposure:\n",
    "The dataset contains names of the hosts, so we will delete the sensitive information such as their ID and names of the hosts in the data cleaning processes.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Data Storage\n",
    "    - Data Security and Right to be forgotten\n",
    "In compliance with regulations such as the GDPR, we respect the 'right to be forgotten.' If an individual whose data is included in our project requests for their data to be erased, we are obligated to do so, provided there are no legal grounds for retaining it. This helps to ensure that individuals maintain control over their personal data.\n",
    "    - Data retention plan:\n",
    "We recognize the importance of not retaining data longer than necessary. Our default position will be to retain data for only as long as it is required for the purpose of the project. Once the data is no longer necessary, we will safely and securely delete it.\n",

    "    - Missing perspectives\n",
    "For this project, we do not obtain the source of expertise knowledge or any affected communities. \n",
    "    - Dataset bias: \n",
    "Our datasets record the fundamental features of listings in San Diego are. The data it contained does not contain any information that can be related to stereotype perpetuation or imbalance classes. One variable that might be confounding in our dataset is “license”. According to our research, Airbnb's official forum provides information regarding this feature. Excerpting from Airbnb’s official response: “Some cities require Hosts to obtain a license or registration number to list their places on Airbnb. The corresponding field on their listing allows them to show that number for compliance.” This provides us an understanding of what a license is and how it applies to the property listing. Additionally, Airbnb also suggests that “license” might not be necessary for some cities, depending on the policies. For those properties that have status ‘city registration pending’ or ‘exempt’, Airbnb claims that it will not affect the veracity and safety of the listings.\n",
    "    - Honest Representation:\n",
    "Our visualizations, summary statistics, and reports will honestly represent the underlying data.\n",
    "    - Privacy in Analysis:\n",
    "Yes, we will remove the data that are related to IDs or host name in the data cleaning process.\n",
    "    - Auditability:\n",
    "Yes, the process will be able to reproduce using the dataset we provides and the technique we used. \n",

    "- Modeling\n",
    "    - Proxy Discrimination:\n",
    "We will ensure that the model does not inadvertently result in discrimination through the use of proxy variables - variables that correlate with protected characteristics such as race, age, or gender.\n",
    "    - Fairness across groups:\n",
    "We will prioritize fairness across all groups to ensure that no one group will receive favor based on any characteristics. We will utilize techniques to check if our model is biased, and if it is, we will mitigate it and re-evaluate our model.\n",
    "    - Metric selection:\n",
    "RMSE\n",
    "    - Explainability:\n",
    "We aim to choose a model that achieves a balance between explainability and accuracy. While more complex models offer better accuracy and predictiveness, it will more often be harder to explain. It is important for us to understand how a model is making its decisions.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "- Deployment\n",
    "    - Monitoring and evaluation:\n",
    "Once the model is deployed, there is a need to monitor the performance and fairness continuously. We will track metrics like the model’s accuracy and potential bias over time and across different groups.\n",
    "Redress\n",
    "    - Roll back:\n",
    "A roll-back plan will be in place to revert to a previous version of the model or even to stop using the model altogether if serious issues arise. This could be necessary if the model starts performing poorly or if significant bias is discovered that can't be quickly mitigated. \n"
